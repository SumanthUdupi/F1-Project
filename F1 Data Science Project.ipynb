    "\n",
    "  -   **Seaborn** (`import seaborn as sns`):  \n",
    "  Seaborn is a tool for making nice-looking charts and graphs. It builds on top of another tool (Matplotlib) to make visualizations prettier and easier to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   **Matplotlib** (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and `import matplotlib`):  \n",
    "  This is a library for creating plots and charts in Python. Think of it like drawing tools that help us visualize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   **NumPy** (`import numpy as np`):  \n",
    "  NumPy is used for handling numbers and calculations in a more efficient way. It’s great for working with large groups of numbers, especially in math-heavy tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   **Scikit-Learn** (`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`):  \n",
    "  This is a popular library for machine learning. It helps split data into training and testing parts, which is a key step in training predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Up Warnings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import warnings\n",

    "   - **Goal**: Calculate the total `points` each driver has scored across all races using the `results_df` table.\n",
    "   - **Hint**: Group by `driverId` and use aggregation to sum the `points`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **_Solution:_** Summing Points Scored by Each Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "      **_Steps :_**\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Merge Driver Details with Results**\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      merged_df = results_df.merge(drivers_df[['driverId', 'forename', 'surname']], on='driverId', how='left')\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      - **Purpose:** Combine race results (`results_df`) with driver details (`drivers_df`) to include the driver's first and last names alongside race data.\n",
    "      - **Key Points:**\n",
    "      - `on='driverId'`: The `driverId` column is used as the key for merging the two datasets.\n",
    "      - `how='left'`: Ensures all rows from `results_df` are retained, even if a matching driver isn't found in `drivers_df`. Missing names will appear as `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Create a Full Driver Name**\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      merged_df['driver_name'] = merged_df['forename'] + ' ' + merged_df['surname']\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      - **Purpose:** Combine the `forename` and `surname` columns into a single column, `driver_name`, for easier readability and grouping.\n",
    "      - **Result:** A new column, `driver_name`, is added to `merged_df`, containing the full name of each driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. **Calculate Total Points by Driver**\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      total_driver_points = merged_df.groupby('driver_name')['points'].sum().reset_index()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      - **Purpose:** Group the dataset by `driver_name` and calculate the total points scored by each driver across all races.\n",
    "      - **Steps:**\n",
    "      - `groupby('driver_name')`: Groups rows by each driver's name.\n",
    "      - `['points'].sum()`: Sums the `points` column for each group (driver).\n",
    "      - `reset_index()`: Converts the grouped result back into a DataFrame for easier manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. **Rename the Points Column**\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      total_driver_points.rename(columns={'points': 'total_points'}, inplace=True)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      - **Purpose:** Rename the `points` column in `total_driver_points` to `total_points` for clarity.\n",
    "      - **Key Argument:**\n",
    "      - `inplace=True`: Ensures the renaming happens directly on the `total_driver_points` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. **Sort Drivers by Total Points**\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      total_driver_points = total_driver_points.sort_values(by='total_points', ascending=False)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      - **Purpose:** Sort the drivers in descending order of their total points.\n",

    "8. **Probability of a Constructor Winning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Calculate the probability of a specific `constructorId` having the highest `position` (winning) across all races in the `results_df` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Hint**\n",
    "      - Filter for rows where `positionOrder` is 1 (indicating a win), count the occurrences for each `constructorId`, and divide by the total number of races to compute the win probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Solution:_** Calculating the Probability of a Constructor Winning\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Steps:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter for Winning Constructors**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   winners_df = results_df[results_df['positionOrder'] == 1]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Filter the `results_df` table to only include rows where the `positionOrder` is 1, which indicates a win.\n",
    "   - **Key Points:**\n",
    "     - `positionOrder == 1`: Selects the races where the constructor finished in first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Count the Number of Wins for Each Constructor**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   win_counts = winners_df['constructorId'].value_counts()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Count the number of wins for each `constructorId` by calculating the occurrences of each constructor in the filtered `winners_df` DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Key Points:**\n",
    "     - `value_counts()`: Returns the count of unique values (constructorId) in the `winners_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the Total Number of Races**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   total_races = results_df['raceId'].nunique()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Calculate the total number of unique races in the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Key Points:**\n",
    "     - `nunique()`: Counts the number of unique values in the `raceId` column, which corresponds to the total number of races.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Probability of Winning for Each Constructor**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   win_probabilities = (win_counts / total_races).reset_index()\n",
    "   win_probabilities.columns = ['constructorId', 'Win Probability']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Calculate the probability of each constructor winning by dividing the number of wins by the total number of races.\n",
    "   - **Steps:**\n",
    "     - `win_counts / total_races`: Calculates the win probability for each constructor.\n",
    "     - `.reset_index()`: Converts the `value_counts` result into a DataFrame.\n",
    "     - Renames the columns to `constructorId` and `Win Probability`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merge Constructor Names**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   win_probabilities = win_probabilities.merge(\n",
    "       constructors_df[['constructorId', 'name']],\n",
    "       on='constructorId',\n",
    "       how='left'\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Merge the `win_probabilities` DataFrame with the `constructors_df` to get the names of the constructors.\n",
    "   - **Key Points:**\n",
    "     - `merge()`: Merges the win probabilities with constructor names by matching `constructorId`.\n",
    "     - `how='left'`: Ensures all constructors in `win_probabilities` are kept, even if there is no match in `constructors_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Select Relevant Columns and Rename**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   win_probabilities = win_probabilities[['constructorId', 'name', 'Win Probability']]\n",
    "   win_probabilities.rename(columns={'name': 'Constructor Name'}, inplace=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Select the relevant columns (`constructorId`, `Constructor Name`, and `Win Probability`) and rename the `name` column for better readability.\n",
    "   - **Key Points:**\n",
    "     - `rename(columns={'name': 'Constructor Name'})`: Changes the column name for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Display the Results**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Winning Probabilities for Each Constructor:\")\n",
    "   print(win_probabilities)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Print the final `win_probabilities` DataFrame, which contains each constructor's name and their probability of winning.\n",
    "   - **Key Points:**\n",
    "     - `win_probabilities`: Displays the calculated win probabilities for each constructor.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Driver Performance Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Goal:** Analyze the performance of drivers based on their race results and standings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Tables Involved:** \n",
    "        - `results_df`\n",
    "        - `drivers_df`\n",
    "        - `driver_standings_df`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Tasks:**\n",
    "        - Find the total number of wins and podium finishes (top 3) for each driver.\n",
    "        - Calculate the average position and points across all races for each driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Solution:_** Driver Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Steps:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert 'position' column to numeric:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    results_df['position'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['position'], errors='coerce')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Convert the `position` column to a numeric format.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Ensures that the `position` column can be used for numerical operations like comparison (`<= 3`). Any invalid values (e.g., text) are replaced with `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate total wins for each driver:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    total_wins = results_df[results_df['position'] == 1].groupby('driverId').size()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Find the total number of wins (1st-place finishes) for each driver.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Filters the rows where `position` is 1 (indicating a win) and groups the data by `driverId` to count the occurrences (number of wins).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate podium finishes for each driver:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    podium_finishes = results_df[results_df['position'] <= 3].groupby('driverId').size()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Calculate the total number of podium finishes (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) for each driver.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Filters for rows where `position` is less than or equal to 3 (top 3 finishes) and counts the number of podium finishes for each driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate average position for each driver:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    average_position = results_df.groupby('driverId')['position'].mean()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Calculate the average finishing position for each driver.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Groups the data by `driverId` and computes the mean position. A lower average position indicates better overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate average points for each driver:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    average_points = results_df.groupby('driverId')['points'].mean()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Calculate the average points earned by each driver.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Groups the data by `driverId` and computes the average number of points. Points are generally awarded based on the finishing position in a race.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculate the variance of position for each driver:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    position_variance = results_df.groupby('driverId')['position'].var()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Calculate the variance of finishing positions for each driver.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Variance measures how consistent a driver is in their race finishes. Lower variance indicates more consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Combine the performance metrics into a new DataFrame:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    performance_metrics = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "        'Wins': total_wins,\n",
    "        'Podium Finishes': podium_finishes,\n",
    "        'Avg Position': average_position,\n",
    "        'Avg Points': average_points,\n",
    "        'Position Variance': position_variance\n",
    "    }).reset_index()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Create a DataFrame with all the calculated performance metrics for each driver.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Combines all the performance metrics (wins, podium finishes, etc.) into a single DataFrame, and resets the index so that `driverId` is a column instead of the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Merge the performance metrics with driver details:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    driver_performance = performance_metrics.merge(drivers_df[['driverId', 'forename', 'surname']],\n",
    "                                                on='driverId', how='left')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Merge the `performance_metrics` DataFrame with `drivers_df` to add the driver's first and last names.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This merge ensures that the final DataFrame contains both the driver's performance metrics and their name, based on `driverId`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Display the final result:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(driver_performance)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Display the `driver_performance` DataFrame.\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This prints the final DataFrame, showing the performance metrics for each driver, along with their first and last names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "The `driver_performance` DataFrame will include the following columns:\n",
    "- **driverId**: The unique ID of each driver.\n",
    "- **Wins**: The total number of 1st-place finishes.\n",
    "- **Podium Finishes**: The total number of top 3 finishes (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).\n",
    "- **Avg Position**: The average finishing position across all races.\n",
    "- **Avg Points**: The average number of points earned by the driver.\n",
    "- **Position Variance**: The variance in the driver's finishing positions (lower is more consistent).\n",
    "- **forename**: The first name of the driver.\n",
    "- **surname**: The last name of the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will display the performance metrics for each driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifying the Most Consistent Drivers:**\n",
    "To identify the drivers with the most consistent performance (low position variance), sort the DataFrame by `Position Variance`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "consistent_drivers = driver_performance.sort_values(by='Position Variance').reset_index(drop=True)\n",
    "print(\"Most Consistent Drivers (Low Position Variance):\")\n",
    "print(consistent_drivers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Sorts the drivers by the variance in their finishing positions, with the most consistent drivers (low variance) appearing at the top.\n",
