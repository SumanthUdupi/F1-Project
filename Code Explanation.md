### Loading of Libraries.

1. **Importing Libraries:**

  -   **Pandas** (`import pandas as pd`):  
  Pandas is like an advanced spreadsheet tool that allows us to load, manipulate, and analyze large sets of data quickly.

  -   **Seaborn** (`import seaborn as sns`):  
  Seaborn is a tool for making nice-looking charts and graphs. It builds on top of another tool (Matplotlib) to make visualizations prettier and easier to create.

  -   **Matplotlib** (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and `import matplotlib`):  
  This is a library for creating plots and charts in Python. Think of it like drawing tools that help us visualize data.

  -   **NumPy** (`import numpy as np`):  
  NumPy is used for handling numbers and calculations in a more efficient way. It’s great for working with large groups of numbers, especially in math-heavy tasks.

  -   **Scikit-Learn** (`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`):  
  This is a popular library for machine learning. It helps split data into training and testing parts, which is a key step in training predictive models.

2. **Setting Up Warnings:**

   ```python
   import warnings
   warnings.simplefilter("ignore")


3. **Printing Version Information:**

   ```python
   print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
   print("Seaborn version:", sns.__version__)
   print("Matplotlib version:", matplotlib.__version__)
   print("NumPy version:", np.__version__)

These lines display the versions of each library in use, which helps in keeping track of the exact setup, since different versions might have small differences in functionality.

### Loading of Data.

1. **Creating a Dictionary of DataFrames**:
   - A dictionary called `dataframes` is created, where each key-value pair represents a table name and its corresponding DataFrame. This setup makes it easy to iterate over multiple tables.

2. **Looping to Display Shapes and Sample Rows**:
   - The first loop iterates over each DataFrame in the dictionary, printing:
     - The name of the DataFrame.
     - The shape of the DataFrame, which shows the number of rows and columns.
     - The first few rows of data using `head()`, giving a sample preview of the data.

3. **Looping to Display Column Names**:
   - The second loop iterates over each DataFrame again to print:
     - The name of each table.
     - A list of the column names in each DataFrame.
     - This part is helpful for understanding the structure of each table and identifying available fields for analysis or further processing.

1. **Filter and Analyze Circuit Locations.**
   - **Goal**: Identify all unique `location` and `country` pairs in the `circuits_df` table and create a table where each `country` has a count of `circuits` it contains.
   - **Hint**: Use grouping to count occurrences and display results.
   
   **_Solution :_** Analyzing Unique Location-Country Pairs and Circuit Counts

      This code looks at the `circuits_df` DataFrame to find unique locations and countries, as well as how many circuits each country has.
      
   **_Steps :_**

   1. **Find Unique Location-Country Pairs**:
      - The code gets unique combinations of `location` and `country` from the `circuits_df` DataFrame. This helps us see where circuits are located without duplicates.

      ```python
      unique_location_country_pairs = circuits_df[['location', 'country']].drop_duplicates()
      
   2. **Print Unique Pairs**:
      - It then prints these unique location-country pairs to show the different circuits.

      ```python
      print("Unique location-country pairs:")
      print(unique_location_country_pairs)
      
   3. **Count Circuits per Country**:
      - The code groups the data by country and counts the number of unique circuits in each country. This tells us how many circuits each country has.

      ```python
      country_circuit_count = circuits_df.groupby('country')['circuitId'].nunique().reset_index(name='circuit_count')
      
   4. **Print Circuit Count**:
      - Finally, it prints the count of circuits for each country.

      ```python
      print("Circuit count per country:")
      print(country_circuit_count)
---      
2. **Matrix of Constructor Standings**
   - **Goal**: Create a matrix showing the `position` of constructors across multiple `races`. Each row represents a `raceId` and each column represents a `constructorId` from the `constructor_standings_df` table.
   - **Hint**: Use pivoting or matrix transformation functions to reshape data.

   **_Solution:_** Creating a Constructor Position Matrix

      This code builds a matrix showing the positions of constructors across multiple races. Each row represents a race (`raceId`), and each column represents a constructor (`name`).

   **_Steps :_**

   1. **Merge Constructor Data**:
      - The `constructor_standings_df` is merged with the `constructors_df` to replace `constructorId` with the constructor's name.
      - This makes the data more understandable by using names instead of numeric IDs.

      ```python
      merged_df = constructor_standings_df.merge(
         constructors_df[['constructorId', 'name']],
         on='constructorId',
         how='left'
      )
      
   2. **Create the Matrix**:

   - The data is pivoted into a matrix where:
      - Rows (index) represent raceId (the race).
      - Columns (columns) represent name (constructor name).
      - Values (values) represent the position of each constructor in the respective race.
      
      ```python
      constructor_position_matrix = merged_df.pivot(
         index='raceId',  
         columns='name',  
         values='position'
      )

   3. **Handle Missing Values**:

   - Missing positions (where a constructor did not participate in a race) are filled with `"N/A"` for clarity.

      ```python
      constructor_position_matrix.fillna("N/A", inplace=True)

   4. **Print the Matrix**:
   The final matrix is printed to display the constructor positions across races.

      ```python
      print("Constructor Position Matrix (Rows: raceId, Columns: Constructor Name):")
      print(constructor_position_matrix)
---

3. **Sum of Points by Driver**
   - **Goal**: Calculate the total `points` each driver has scored across all races using the `results_df` table.
   - **Hint**: Group by `driverId` and use aggregation to sum the `points`.

   **_Solution:_** Summing Points Scored by Each Driver

      **_Steps :_**

   1. **Merge Driver Details with Results**
      ```python
      merged_df = results_df.merge(drivers_df[['driverId', 'forename', 'surname']], on='driverId', how='left')
      ```
      - **Purpose:** Combine race results (`results_df`) with driver details (`drivers_df`) to include the driver's first and last names alongside race data.
      - **Key Points:**
      - `on='driverId'`: The `driverId` column is used as the key for merging the two datasets.
      - `how='left'`: Ensures all rows from `results_df` are retained, even if a matching driver isn't found in `drivers_df`. Missing names will appear as `NaN`.

   2. **Create a Full Driver Name**
      ```python
      merged_df['driver_name'] = merged_df['forename'] + ' ' + merged_df['surname']
      ```
      - **Purpose:** Combine the `forename` and `surname` columns into a single column, `driver_name`, for easier readability and grouping.
      - **Result:** A new column, `driver_name`, is added to `merged_df`, containing the full name of each driver.

   3. **Calculate Total Points by Driver**
      ```python
      total_driver_points = merged_df.groupby('driver_name')['points'].sum().reset_index()
      ```
      - **Purpose:** Group the dataset by `driver_name` and calculate the total points scored by each driver across all races.
      - **Steps:**
      - `groupby('driver_name')`: Groups rows by each driver's name.
      - `['points'].sum()`: Sums the `points` column for each group (driver).
      - `reset_index()`: Converts the grouped result back into a DataFrame for easier manipulation.

   4. **Rename the Points Column**
      ```python
      total_driver_points.rename(columns={'points': 'total_points'}, inplace=True)
      ```
      - **Purpose:** Rename the `points` column in `total_driver_points` to `total_points` for clarity.
      - **Key Argument:**
      - `inplace=True`: Ensures the renaming happens directly on the `total_driver_points` DataFrame.

   5. **Sort Drivers by Total Points**
      ```python
      total_driver_points = total_driver_points.sort_values(by='total_points', ascending=False)
      ```
      - **Purpose:** Sort the drivers in descending order of their total points.
      - **Key Points:**
      - `by='total_points'`: Specifies the column used for sorting.
      - `ascending=False`: Ensures the drivers with the highest points appear first.

   6. **Display the Results**
      ```python
      print("Total Points Scored by Each Driver:")
      print(total_driver_points)
      ```
      - **Purpose:** Print the final `total_driver_points` DataFrame, showing each driver's name and their total points in descending order.

   ---

4. **Eigenvalues of a Points Matrix**
   - **Goal**: Construct a 2x2 matrix of points scored by two constructors in two races from `constructor_results_df` and compute its eigenvalues.
   - **Hint**: Choose two specific `constructorId`s and `raceId`s for simplicity.

**_Solution:_** Analyzing Constructor Points and Eigenvalues

This code calculates a matrix of points scored by two constructors in two races and computes the eigenvalues of that matrix. It uses the `constructor_results_df` DataFrame to derive the points.

**_Steps:_**

   1. **Group Data by Constructor and Race**:
   - The data is grouped by `constructorId` and `raceId`, and the total points scored by each constructor in each race are calculated.

      ```python
      selected_data = constructor_results_df.groupby(['constructorId', 'raceId'])['points'].sum().reset_index()

   2. **Select Two Constructors and Two Races**:
   - Two constructors and two races are chosen for simplicity and analysis.

      ```python
      constructors = selected_data['constructorId'].unique()[:2]
      races = selected_data['raceId'].unique()[:2]
   
   3. **Construct the Points Matrix**:

   - A 2x2 matrix is created where each cell contains the points scored by a specific constructor in a specific race. If no points are available for a combination, it is set to 0.

      ```python
         points_matrix = np.zeros((2, 2))
         for i, constructor in enumerate(constructors):
            for j, race in enumerate(races):
               points = selected_data[
                     (selected_data['constructorId'] == constructor) & 
                     (selected_data['raceId'] == race)
               ]['points']
               points_matrix[i, j] = points.values[0] if not points.empty else 0

   4. **Compute Eigenvalues**:

   - The eigenvalues of the points matrix are calculated using NumPy's eigvals function. These eigenvalues provide mathematical insights into the matrix.
         
      ```python
         eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(points_matrix)

   5. **Print the Results**:

   - The constructed points matrix and its eigenvalues are displayed.

      ```python
         print("Points Matrix:")
         print(points_matrix)
         print("\nEigenvalues:")
         print(eigenvalues)

**_Explanation of the Output:_**
   
   **Points Matrix**:
   - The matrix represents the points scored by two constructors in two races.
   - Each row is a race, and each column is a constructor.
   - Example:
   - Constructor 1 scored **0 points** in Race 1 and **1 point** in Race 2.
   - Constructor 2 scored **0 points** in Race 1 and **4 points** in Race 2.

   **Eigenvalues**:
   - Eigenvalues summarize the matrix's characteristics.
   - For this matrix:
   - **0** means there’s no contribution from Constructor 1 in Race 1.
   - **4** reflects Constructor 2’s dominant score in Race 2.

## Calculus Exercises

5. **Rate of Change in Lap Time**

   - **Goal**: Determine the rate of change in lap times for a given `driverId` by analyzing successive lap times in the `lap_times_df` table.

   - **Hint**
      - Use `sort_values()` to order the data by `driverId` and `lap` for proper calculation.
      - Use `diff()` to compute the time difference between consecutive laps within each driver's lap records.

**_Solution:_** Calculating Lap Time Change for Each Driver

**_Steps:_**

1. **Sort Lap Time Data**
   ```python
   lap_times_df = lap_times_df.sort_values(by=['driverId', 'lap'])
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Ensure the data is ordered by `driverId` and `lap` so that successive laps are properly aligned for computation.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Sorting is crucial for the `diff()` function to work as intended.
     - `by=['driverId', 'lap']`: Sorts data first by `driverId` and then by `lap` number.

2. **Calculate Rate of Change in Lap Times**
   ```python
   lap_times_df['lap_time_change'] = lap_times_df.groupby('driverId')['milliseconds'].diff()
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Compute the difference in lap times (`milliseconds`) for consecutive laps within each `driverId`.
   - **Steps:**
     - `groupby('driverId')`: Groups data by `driverId` so each driver's laps are processed independently.
     - `['milliseconds'].diff()`: Calculates the difference in lap times between consecutive laps.
   - **Result:** A new column, `lap_time_change`, is added to the DataFrame, indicating the change in lap time for each driver.

3. **Display Relevant Data**
   ```python
   print("Rate of change of lap times for each driver:")
   print(lap_times_df[['driverId', 'lap', 'milliseconds', 'lap_time_change']].tail())
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Display the relevant columns to understand the lap time changes for each driver.
   - **Key Points:**
     - `[['driverId', 'lap', 'milliseconds', 'lap_time_change']]`: Selects only the necessary columns for display.
     - `.tail()`: Shows the last few rows of the DataFrame to verify results.

6. **Total Pit Stop Duration Over Time**

   - **Goal**: Calculate the total pit stop `duration` for a `driverId` over the course of a race, analyzing how pit stop duration changes across `laps` in `pit_stops_df`.

   - **Hint**: Use the cumulative sum and analyze derivatives of cumulative times to find patterns.

**_Solution:_** Calculating Total Pit Stop Duration and Changes Across Laps

**_Steps:_**

1. **Convert Duration to Numeric Values**
   ```python
   pit_stops_df['duration'] = pd.to_numeric(pit_stops_df['duration'], errors='coerce')
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Ensure the `duration` column is in a numeric format to perform arithmetic operations.
   - **Key Points:**
     - `pd.to_numeric()`: Converts `duration` to a numeric data type. If any value cannot be converted, it will be set as `NaN` (due to `errors='coerce'`).

2. **Calculate Cumulative Duration for Each Driver in Each Race**
   ```python
   pit_stops_df['cumulative_duration'] = pit_stops_df.groupby(['driverId', 'raceId'])['duration'].cumsum()
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the cumulative pit stop duration for each `driverId` in each race (`raceId`), showing how the total duration builds up lap by lap.
   - **Steps:**
     - `groupby(['driverId', 'raceId'])`: Groups the data by `driverId` and `raceId` so that the cumulative sum is computed separately for each driver in each race.
     - `['duration'].cumsum()`: Computes the cumulative sum of pit stop durations for each group.

3. **Calculate Change in Cumulative Duration Between Successive Laps**
   ```python
   pit_stops_df['duration_change'] = pit_stops_df.groupby(['driverId', 'raceId'])['cumulative_duration'].diff()
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the change in cumulative pit stop duration between successive laps for each driver.
   - **Key Points:**
     - `groupby(['driverId', 'raceId'])`: Groups by both `driverId` and `raceId` to calculate differences within each race and driver.

7. **Optimization of Fastest Lap Speed**

   - **Goal**: Identify the `fastestLapSpeed` from `results_df` for each `driverId` and find the lap where they achieved it to determine the race's optimal lap.

   - **Hint**
      - Use `groupby()` to group the data by `driverId` and apply the `max()` function to isolate the fastest lap speeds.
      - Utilize `idxmax()` to retrieve the row with the maximum lap speed for each driver.

**_Solution:_** Identifying the Fastest Lap Speed for Each Driver

**_Steps:_**

1. **Filter Out Invalid Fastest Lap Data**
   ```python
   valid_results_df = results_df.dropna(subset=['fastestLapSpeed'])
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Remove rows where the `fastestLapSpeed` is `NaN`, as these rows do not contain valid lap speed data.
   - **Key Points:**
     - `dropna(subset=['fastestLapSpeed'])`: Filters out rows where `fastestLapSpeed` is missing to ensure calculations are done only on valid data.

2. **Group by Driver and Identify Fastest Lap Speed**
   ```python
   fastest_lap = valid_results_df.groupby('driverId').apply(
       lambda x: x.loc[x['fastestLapSpeed'].idxmax(), ['raceId', 'fastestLap', 'fastestLapSpeed']]
   ).reset_index(drop=True)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Group the dataset by `driverId` and apply a function to find the lap with the highest `fastestLapSpeed` for each driver.
   - **Steps:**
     - `groupby('driverId')`: Groups the data by `driverId`, ensuring the calculation is done per driver.
     - `apply(lambda x: ...)`: For each driver, a lambda function is used to find the row with the maximum `fastestLapSpeed`.
     - `idxmax()`: Returns the index of the row with the maximum `fastestLapSpeed`.
     - `.loc[]`: Selects the specific row corresponding to the maximum lap speed and extracts relevant columns (`raceId`, `fastestLap`, `fastestLapSpeed`).
   - **Result:** A DataFrame `fastest_lap` containing each driver's fastest lap details (race, lap, and speed).

3. **Rename Columns for Better Readability**
   ```python
   fastest_lap.rename(columns={'raceId': 'Race ID', 'fastestLap': 'Fastest Lap', 'fastestLapSpeed': 'Fastest Speed'}, inplace=True)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Rename the columns for improved clarity and better presentation of the final results.
   - **Key Points:**
     - `inplace=True`: Ensures the column renaming happens directly on the `fastest_lap` DataFrame without needing to assign it to a new variable.

4. **Display the Results**
   ```python
   print("Fastest Lap Speed for Each Driver and Corresponding Lap:")
   print(fastest_lap)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Print the final `fastest_lap` DataFrame, displaying each driver's fastest lap, the corresponding lap number, and the speed achieved.
   - **Key Points:**
     - `fastest_lap`: The DataFrame contains the desired results, showing which lap was the fastest and the corresponding speed for each driver.

## Statistics Basics

1. **Driver Performance Analysis:**

    - **Goal:** Analyze the performance of drivers based on their race results and standings.

    - **Tables Involved:** 
        - `results_df`
        - `drivers_df`
        - `driver_standings_df`

    - **Tasks:**
        - Find the total number of wins and podium finishes (top 3) for each driver.
        - Calculate the average position and points across all races for each driver.

**_Solution:_** Driver Performance Analysis

**_Steps:_**

1. **Convert 'position' column to numeric:**
    ```python
    results_df['position'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['position'], errors='coerce')
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Convert the `position` column to a numeric format.
    - **Explanation:** Ensures that the `position` column can be used for numerical operations like comparison (`<= 3`). Any invalid values (e.g., text) are replaced with `NaN`.

2. **Calculate total wins for each driver:**
    ```python
    total_wins = results_df[results_df['position'] == 1].groupby('driverId').size()
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Find the total number of wins (1st-place finishes) for each driver.
    - **Explanation:** Filters the rows where `position` is 1 (indicating a win) and groups the data by `driverId` to count the occurrences (number of wins).

3. **Calculate podium finishes for each driver:**
    ```python
    podium_finishes = results_df[results_df['position'] <= 3].groupby('driverId').size()
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Calculate the total number of podium finishes (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) for each driver.
    - **Explanation:** Filters for rows where `position` is less than or equal to 3 (top 3 finishes) and counts the number of podium finishes for each driver.

4. **Calculate average position for each driver:**
    ```python
    average_position = results_df.groupby('driverId')['position'].mean()
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Calculate the average finishing position for each driver.
    - **Explanation:** Groups the data by `driverId` and computes the mean position. A lower average position indicates better overall performance.

5. **Calculate average points for each driver:**
    ```python
    average_points = results_df.groupby('driverId')['points'].mean()
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Calculate the average points earned by each driver.
    - **Explanation:** Groups the data by `driverId` and computes the average number of points. Points are generally awarded based on the finishing position in a race.

6. **Calculate the variance of position for each driver:**
    ```python
    position_variance = results_df.groupby('driverId')['position'].var()
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Calculate the variance of finishing positions for each driver.
    - **Explanation:** Variance measures how consistent a driver is in their race finishes. Lower variance indicates more consistency.

7. **Combine the performance metrics into a new DataFrame:**
    ```python
    performance_metrics = pd.DataFrame({
        'Wins': total_wins,
        'Podium Finishes': podium_finishes,
        'Avg Position': average_position,
        'Avg Points': average_points,
        'Position Variance': position_variance
    }).reset_index()
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Create a DataFrame with all the calculated performance metrics for each driver.
    - **Explanation:** Combines all the performance metrics (wins, podium finishes, etc.) into a single DataFrame, and resets the index so that `driverId` is a column instead of the index.

8. **Merge the performance metrics with driver details:**
    ```python
    driver_performance = performance_metrics.merge(drivers_df[['driverId', 'forename', 'surname']],
                                                on='driverId', how='left')
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Merge the `performance_metrics` DataFrame with `drivers_df` to add the driver's first and last names.
    - **Explanation:** This merge ensures that the final DataFrame contains both the driver's performance metrics and their name, based on `driverId`.

9. **Display the final result:**
    ```python
    print(driver_performance)
    ```

    - **Explanation:** This prints the final DataFrame, showing the performance metrics for each driver, along with their first and last names.

**Result:**
The `driver_performance` DataFrame will include the following columns:
- **driverId**: The unique ID of each driver.
- **Wins**: The total number of 1st-place finishes.
- **Podium Finishes**: The total number of top 3 finishes (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Avg Position**: The average finishing position across all races.
- **Avg Points**: The average number of points earned by the driver.
- **Position Variance**: The variance in the driver's finishing positions (lower is more consistent).
- **forename**: The first name of the driver.
- **surname**: The last name of the driver.

The output will display the performance metrics for each driver.

**Identifying the Most Consistent Drivers:**
To identify the drivers with the most consistent performance (low position variance), sort the DataFrame by `Position Variance`:
```python
consistent_drivers = driver_performance.sort_values(by='Position Variance').reset_index(drop=True)
print("Most Consistent Drivers (Low Position Variance):")
print(consistent_drivers)
```
- **Purpose:** Sorts the drivers by the variance in their finishing positions, with the most consistent drivers (low variance) appearing at the top.
