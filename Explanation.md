## Basic Concepts

### 1. Charts and Graphs

**1.1 Bar Chart Assignments**

1.  **Wins per Constructor:** Create a bar chart showing the total number of race wins for each constructor. Use the `constructors_df` and `constructor_standings_df` tables. Group by `constructorId` (joining with `constructors_df` to get the constructor name) and sum the `wins` column.

2.  **Points per Constructor in a Season:** Create a bar chart showing the total points earned by each constructor in a specific season (e.g., 2008, 2023). Use the `constructor_standings_df` and `races_df` tables. Filter by a specific `year` in `races_df` (joining on `raceId`), then group by `constructorId` and sum the `points`.

3.  **Race Wins per Driver:** Create a bar chart displaying the total number of race wins for each driver. Use the `drivers_df` and `driver_standings_df` tables. Group by `driverId` (joining with `drivers_df` to get the driver name) and sum the `wins` column.

4.  **Number of Races per Circuit:** Create a bar chart showing the number of races held at each circuit. Use the `circuits_df` and `races_df` tables. Group by `circuitId` (joining with `circuits_df` to get the circuit name) and count the number of races.

**1.2 Line Chart Assignments**

5.  **Constructor Points Over Time:** Create a line chart showing how constructor points have changed over time. Use the `constructor_standings_df` and `races_df` tables. Group by `year` (from `races_df` by joining on `raceId`) and `constructorId`, summing the `points`. You can create separate lines for different constructors or focus on a single constructor.

6.  **Driver Points Over Time:** Create a line chart showing how driver points have changed over time. Use the `driver_standings_df` and `races_df` tables. Group by `year` and `driverId` and sum the `points`.

7.  **Average Lap Time Progression During a Race:** Create a line chart showing how the average lap time changes during a specific race. Use the `lap_times_df` table. Filter for a specific `raceId`, group by `lap`, and calculate the average `milliseconds`.

**1.3 Pie Chart Assignments**

8.  **Driver Nationalities:** Create a pie chart showing the distribution of driver nationalities. Use the `drivers_df` table and count the occurrences of each `nationality`.

9.  **Constructor Nationalities:** Create a pie chart showing the distribution of constructor nationalities. Use the `constructors_df` table and count the occurrences of each `nationality`.

10. **Status Distribution (Reasons for Retirement):** Create a pie chart showing the distribution of reasons for race retirements. Use the `results_df` and `status_df` tables. Join on `statusId` and count the occurrences of each `status`.

**1.4 Scatter Plot Assignments**

11. **Qualifying Position vs. Race Finish Position:** Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between qualifying position and race finish position. Use the `qualifying_df` and `results_df` tables. Join on `raceId` and `driverId`. Plot `position` from `qualifying_df` against `position` from `results_df`.

12. **Latitude vs. Longitude of Circuits:** Create a scatter plot showing the geographical locations of the circuits. Use the `circuits_df` table. Plot `lat` against `lng`.

13. **Fastest Lap Speed vs. Average Lap Speed:** Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between fastest lap speed and average lap speed. Use the `results_df` table. Calculate the average lap speed using `milliseconds` and `laps` columns, and plot it against `fastestLapSpeed`.

**1.5 Histogram Assignments**

14. **Distribution of Lap Times:** Create a histogram showing the distribution of lap times for a specific race or driver. Use the `lap_times_df` table. Filter for the desired `raceId` or `driverId` and create a histogram of the `milliseconds` column.

15. **Distribution of Qualifying Times (Q1, Q2, Q3):** Create histograms showing the distribution of qualifying times for Q1, Q2, and Q3. Use the `qualifying_df` table and create separate histograms for the `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` columns.

16. **Distribution of Race Finish Positions:** Create a histogram showing the distribution of race finish positions. Use the `results_df` table and create a histogram of the `positionOrder` column.

**1.6 Box Plot Assignments**

17. **Lap Time Distribution per Driver (in a Race):** Create box plots comparing the distribution of lap times for different drivers in a specific race. Use the `lap_times_df` table. Filter by a specific `raceId` and create box plots with `driverId` on the x-axis and `milliseconds` on the y-axis.

18. **Qualifying Time Distribution per Constructor:** Create box plots comparing the distribution of qualifying times per constructor. Use the `qualifying_df` table and create box plots of `q1`, `q2`, or `q3` times, with `constructorId` on the x-axis.

19. **Points Distribution per Season:** Create box plots comparing the distribution of points per season. Use the `driver_standings_df` or `constructor_standings_df` table and join with `races_df` to get the `year`. Create box plots of points with `year` on the x-axis.

 ## Explainations:

 1. **Basic Libraries:**

* **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis. Helps in organizing tabular data (like Excel sheets).
* **numpy**: Useful for working with numerical data and performing mathematical operations.
* **requests**: Allows fetching data from the internet via APIs (like getting live data).
* **os**: Helps interact with the systemâ€™s file structure (e.g., checking files or creating directories).

2. **Visualization Libraries:**

* **matplotlib.pyplot**: Creates static charts like line graphs and bar charts.
* **seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib for more visually appealing charts with simpler syntax.
* **plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, plotly.figure_factory**: Create highly interactive, customizable visualizations.

3. **Geospatial Libraries:**

* **folium**: Creates interactive maps with data points (e.g., plotting locations).
* **geopandas**: Extends pandas to handle geographical data (e.g., shapes of countries).

4. **Interactive Dashboards:**

* **dash**: A framework to build interactive web-based dashboards.
* **dash_core_components, dash_html_components**: Provide components (like dropdowns, buttons, graphs) for Dash apps.
* **Input, Output**: Used for connecting interactive components in Dash (e.g., clicking a button changes a graph).

5. **Network Graphs:**

* **networkx**: Handles network-related data like social connections or graph structures.

6. **Streamlit:** Simplifies the creation of interactive apps for data visualization or analytics.

7. **Code Explanation:**

* **print(plt.style.available)**: Lists all available styles for Matplotlib charts (e.g., "ggplot," "seaborn," etc.).
* **plt.style.use('ggplot')**: Sets the chart style to look like "ggplot" (clean, grid-based visuals).
* **sns.set(style='darkgrid')**: Configures Seaborn to use a dark grid background for its charts.
**Plotly Configuration:**
    * **plotly.io**: Handles how Plotly renders charts.
    * **pio.renderers.default = 'notebook'**: Ensures Plotly visualizations work smoothly inside Jupyter Notebook.
